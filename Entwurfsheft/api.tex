\subsubsection{\label{API} API Package}
\paragraph{Package: api} This package is the interface between the client's application and the server application. 
All requests are sent to this API(package) in JSON format.

\paragraph{Class: FrontendAPI}

This class is the main interface of the whole application. The client application
can get the api status code to obtain information regarding the execution of api calls (e.g. status code
changes when an exception has been thrown)

\subparagraph{static get\texttt{\_}FrontendAPI(): FrontendAPI} returns the FrontendAPI in singleton design fashion, meaning 
there is only one instance of FrontendAPI in circulation at all times.
